The Center for Open Science (COS) complies with the United States Federal and State of Virginia employment laws and regulations. This manual is subject to change to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations. This manual will be reviewed and updated periodically as a means of continuous improvement to the COS’s standard practices and operations.

<h2>
<a name="cos-office-environment" class="anchor" href="#cos-office-environment"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>COS Office Environment</h2>

<p>The COS operates on the principle of openness. COS provides a 24/7 accessible working environment to staff. The COS is a highly collaborative environment and there is no assigned seating. Everyone operates out of the main "bullpen" area.  While there is an emphasis on collaboration, this model also increases the need to be sensitive to noise so that all staff can be productive in the space.  Staff are encouraged to retreat to a private office to hold meetings or to have phone and video calls.</p>

<p>The COS will host a variety of community events during normal business hours, in the evenings, and on weekends. During these events, a host member of the COS staff will be present. The host staff member is responsible for ensuring responsible use of the space, properly disposing of any trash following the event, and properly closing up. </p>

<p>The COS kitchen is a shared space for COS staff and visitors. Each Friday COS staff clean out of the fridge by either taking home their perishable items or throwing them away. The cleanliness of the COS kitchen and other space is the responsibility of everyone who uses it. </p>

<h2>
<a name="hiring-practices" class="anchor" href="#hiring-practices"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hiring Practices</h2>

<p>COS is an equal opportunity environment for employment and advancement. The COS and its staff shall not discriminate against individuals on the basis of age, race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, veteran status, national origin, ancestry or disability. Positive action shall be taken to ensure the fulfillment of this policy across organizational activities including:</p>

<p>a.     Hiring, placement, upgrading, transfer, or demotion;</p>

<p>b.     Recruitment, advertising, or solicitation for employment;</p>

<p>c.     Treatment during employment; and</p>

<p>d.     Selection for training</p>

<p>This policy is consistent with the requirements and objectives set forth by the Presidential Executive Order 11246 as amended by Executive Order 11375.</p>

<p>The COS employs persons qualified for each position by virtue of job-related standards of education, training, experience, or personal qualifications. Additionally, the COS adheres to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 regarding discrimination of persons with disabilities.</p>

<p>The COS is committed to creating and maintaining a work climate that is free from discrimination and harassment. </p>

<h2>
<a name="americans-with-disabilities-act-considerations" class="anchor" href="#americans-with-disabilities-act-considerations"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Americans with Disabilities Act Considerations</h2>

<p>The COS is committed to full compliance with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The COS provides a safe and healthy work environment.  Reasonable working accommodations are offered to fulfill organizational performance expectations. In some cases, due to health-related or physical conditions, a staff member may be unable to meet standard expectations in the existing working conditions. The COS will make every reasonable effort to accommodate specific health problems or physical restrictions by fashioning a safe and productive work environment. These situations will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>
<a name="general-criteria-for-hiring-selection" class="anchor" href="#general-criteria-for-hiring-selection"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General Criteria for Hiring Selection</h2>

<p><strong>Best Qualified:</strong> Following interviews, reference checks, and other necessary procedures, the best-qualified applicant will be offered the job.</p>

<p><strong>Education requirements:</strong> The COS is flexible with educational requirements using experience, when applicable, as a substitute.</p>

<p><strong>Disqualified:</strong> Any applicant who has membership in a party or organization with the objectives of overthrowing the United States Government will be disqualified.</p>

<p><strong>Offer by Letter:</strong>  Once selection has been made, an offer of employment will be made by letter and digitally distributed.  Such letter will contain position/title, annual or hourly salary, starting date, and any other specific items agreed upon by the COS. </p>

<p><strong>Acceptance by Letter:</strong>  Acceptance of employment will be indicated by digitally signing offer letter and returning it to the Office Manager.</p>

<h2>
<a name="employment-status" class="anchor" href="#employment-status"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Employment Status</h2>

<p>All employees are assigned to an employee status category determined at the time of employment based upon the needs of the COS. All staff belong to one of the following categories:</p>

<p><strong>Full-Time:</strong> Employees who are not on a temporary status and who are regularly scheduled to work a full-time (40+) hour week are eligible for the COS benefits package (health and dental insurance, disability insurance, and 401(k) program) and are subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.</p>

<p><strong>Part-Time:</strong> Employees who are regularly scheduled to work less than the full-time work week, but not the COS benefits package (see above). These employees are eligible for benefits including occasionally catered meals and the stocked kitchen.</p>

<p><strong>Seasonal:</strong> Employees who are employed by the organization to work part- or full-time are eligible for certain benefits including occasionally catered meals and the stocked kitchen. </p>

<p>**Independent Contractors:* *For all independent contractors, there shall be a contract detailing the responsibilities, deliverables, time frame, fee and method of payment. Both the independent contractor and an authorized representative of the COS shall sign the contract and follow policies and guidelines prescribed by law or the written contract. All independent contractors will submit a W-9 form for tax purposes. </p>

<h2>
<a name="employment-classification" class="anchor" href="#employment-classification"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Employment Classification</h2>

<p>All employees are assigned to one of the following classifications of employment in compliance with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act:</p>

<p><strong>Exempt Employees:</strong> Exempt employees are those whose primary duties consist of "administrative," "professional," or "executive" functions.  This employee would work on a salaried basis, and would meet the salary and job requirements as set forth by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Such employees are exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>

<p><strong>Non-exempt Employees:</strong> An employee who is not considered to be exempt and who is subject to the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. As a tax-exempt, not for profit organization, COS may elect to require non-exempt employees to take compensatory time off during the workweek in which the overtime occurred in lieu of overtime wages. </p>

<p><strong>Students, Trainees, and Volunteers:</strong> Students, trainees, and volunteers, when acting on behalf of the COS will be governed by the terms set forth in their employment offer letters. The offer letter will include at a minimum, the role of the individual and compensation arrangements.  In all other respects, students, trainees, and volunteers, will be subject to the provisions of this policy manual. </p>

<h2>
<a name="paid-time-off-pto" class="anchor" href="#paid-time-off-pto"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Paid Time Off (PTO)</h2>

<p>At the beginning of each year, COS employees receive credit for fifteen (15) days of "Paid Time Off" (PTO).  Upon termination all unused PTO will be forfeited.  PTO is not accrued and has no cash value.  Staff must confirm PTO with a supervisor and indicate the time off on the COS Google shared calendar.  Anyone who cannot work due to an illness or emergency should notify supervisors, the office manager, or the team by emailing <a href="mailto:all@cos.org">all@centerforopenscience.org</a>.  Any absence for two (2) consecutive days without proper notification will be considered a voluntary separation from COS.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="new-employee-orientation" class="anchor" href="#new-employee-orientation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>New Employee Orientation</h2>

<p>Each new employee will be given a general orientation by the Office Manager. This orientation will include a review of the personnel policies and procedures,  the employee's position description, employee benefits, and any other materials necessary for the individual to understand the COS and his or her job.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="personnel-records" class="anchor" href="#personnel-records"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personnel Records</h2>

<h2>
<a name="performance-appraisal-process" class="anchor" href="#performance-appraisal-process"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Performance Appraisal Process</h2>

<p>The aim of the COS performance appraisal process is to provide staff with guidance to help them to achieve their job and career goals, to recognize their achievements and to facilitate achievement of COS’s strategic and business goals. You will have the opportunity to participate in planning your work and setting your goals in conjunction with the management team on an ongoing basis and formally during your 6 month and annual appraisal meeting. The performance appraisal process is an opportunity for open, honest communication and feedback about your work and your future at the COS.  </p>

<p>[Note: The formal Performance Appraisal Process is still in development]  </p>

<p>A special evaluation may be conducted at the request of the employee or the management team.  Special evaluations are normally conducted as a consequence of a particular incident, either positive or negative.</p>

<p>Salaries will be reviewed annually and adjusted in line with performance. The salary review process will take into account overall performance and the COS’s budget status and projections. Evaluations will not necessarily lead to a change in compensation.</p>

<h2>
<a name="pay-schedule-15th-and-3031" class="anchor" href="#pay-schedule-15th-and-3031"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pay Schedule (15th and 30/31)</h2>

<p>Pay dates for COS staff are on the 15th and the 30/31 of each month (or last business day preceding the 15th or the last day of the month).  When a pay day falls on a holiday, the pay date will be on the last business day prior to the holiday. The COS is required by law to make certain deductions for federal and state withholding taxes and social security. COS employees may voluntarily have deductions made from their paychecks on a pre-tax basis to pay for any dependent(s) health and dental insurance coverage. </p>

<p>If a paycheck is lost or stolen, it is the individual’s responsibility to report it immediately to the Office Manager, and submit an email statement certifying that the pay check was lost or stolen.  Following that, a replacement check will be issued. </p>

<p>Notify the Office Manager of changes to direct deposit by completing and returning a new Direct Deposit slip.</p>

<h2>
<a name="reimbursements" class="anchor" href="#reimbursements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reimbursements</h2>

<p>COS staff members may pay for pre-authorized expenses while traveling. Pre-authorized expenses include meals, lodging, telephone, internet charges, and mileage. COS will reimburse staff for mileage traveled for COS related activities. COS will reimburse mileage based upon the standard <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/2013-Standard-Mileage-Rates-Up-1-Cent-per-Mile-for-Business,-Medical-and-Moving">IRS Mileage Rates</a>. Parking violations, towing, and traffic fines will not be reimbursed. </p>

<p>To receive reimbursement, staff are to submit all receipts and an itemized reimbursement request form to the Office Manager within thirty (30) days of the reimbursable expense(s). Late submissions will not be eligible for reimbursement.  </p>

<p>Although COS encourages all staff to use Google Voice for all COS related phone calls, COS recognizes that job responsibilities may include use of personal cell phones. Employees who use their personal cell phones for COS related activities are to notify the Office Manager and to supply proof of usage.  COS will reimburse staff based upon the following cell phone usage rates: Occasional Usage - $15/month or Regular Usage - $50/month. Employees can request an upgrade with the Office Manager should their use exceed the occasional or moderate usage rates. </p>

<p>Reimbursement payments will be made on the 10th and 20th of every month. </p>

<h2>
<a name="use-of-email--personal-computer-equipment" class="anchor" href="#use-of-email--personal-computer-equipment"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use of Email &amp; Personal Computer Equipment</h2>

<p>All staff will receive a COS email address.  Use of personal equipment for COS projects is not encouraged as COS is not liable for covering any damages to personal property.  If your COS technology needs are not being met, please discuss them with the Office Manager.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="inclement-weather-policy" class="anchor" href="#inclement-weather-policy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inclement Weather Policy</h2>

<p>The COS has an inclement weather policy to avoid having staff take risks associated with travel during hazardous road conditions. Inclement weather is defined as adverse weather conditions that have the potential of making travel to and/or from work hazardous for employees. The COS management team will examine current and pending weather conditions and determine the appropriate hours of operations.  If weather conditions are deemed hazardous, the office will open late, close early, or close for the day.  Employees who decide not to drive into the office based upon personal judgment regarding inclement weather and road conditions are allowed to use PTO.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="smoking-controlled-substances-alcohol-and-firearms" class="anchor" href="#smoking-controlled-substances-alcohol-and-firearms"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Smoking, controlled substances, alcohol, and firearms</h2>

<p>Smoking, controlled substances, and firearms are prohibited on COS premises.  The law defines smoking as the "act of lighting, smoking or carrying a lighted or smoldering cigar, cigarette or pipe of any kind." </p>

<p>In compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the COS team members are required to be in appropriate mental and physical condition in order to carry out their role and responsibilities to the highest level of excellence. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, possession or use of a controlled substance on COS premises or while conducting COS business at another location is prohibited.  Failure to adhere to this policy could result in immediate termination. </p>

<p>Alcohol may be included in COS special events, but is not permitted during ordinary working circumstances.</p>

<h2>
<a name="emergency-procedures" class="anchor" href="#emergency-procedures"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Emergency Procedures</h2>

<a name="grievances" class="anchor" href="#grievances"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grievances</h2>

<p>A grievance is a formal expression of dissatisfaction about a work situation by an individual or group. The COS’s grievance procedure is formal procedure that the COS and its staff members will follow to deal with or resolve workplace problems. The policy is: </p>

<p><em>Easy to use:</em> The COS's grievance procedure is regularly updated to take into account other best practice models. As a result, the grievance procedure should be clear and easy to use.</p>

<p><em>Confidential:</em> Only the staff members directly involved in the grievance, or its resolution, have access to information about the grievance. Information will go onto a staff member’s personnel file if a formal action is taken arising from the grievance.</p>

<p><em>Impartial</em>: All parties have opportunity to communicate their perspective on the situation. No assumptions are made or actions taken until all parties contribute information for consideration. </p>

<p><em>Sensitive</em>: All grievances will be dealt with sensitively and professionally by staff experienced in these matters.</p>

<p>*Free of retaliation or victimization: *Staff involved in a grievance shall not victimized by anyone for coming forward with the grievance or for assisting in its resolution. Any victimization or retaliation may result in disciplinary action including termination of the perpetrator. </p>

<p>*Timely: *Grievances are addressed promptly. </p>

<h2>
<a name="employee-grievance-procedure" class="anchor" href="#employee-grievance-procedure"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Employee Grievance Procedure</h2>

<p><strong>Informal stage:</strong> If an employee has a complaint that involves another COS staff member, they should try to resolve the matter by direct approach to the </p>

<p>employee or employees involved. </p>

<p><strong>Formal stage:</strong> If the matter remains unresolved, employees are to report the incident to management immediately. The COS management will resolve the issue and decide if a formal meeting between the parties is necessary. This meeting should be held within 10 working days of the grievance.  If, after any action to resolve the grievance taken by the directorship, the employee is still dissatisfied, they may file an appeal. </p>

<h2>
<a name="harassment-and-unfair-treatment" class="anchor" href="#harassment-and-unfair-treatment"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Harassment and Unfair Treatment</h2>

<p>All staff shall endeavor to maintain a workplace characterized by mutual respect to maintain a productive and pleasant work environment.  Accordingly, any form of harassment, intimidation, and discrimination in the workplace will not be tolerated. </p>

<p>Sexual harassment is defined as a form of sex discrimination, consisting of unwanted sexual advances.  Sexual harassment refers to behavior that is not welcome, that is personally offensive, and that fails to respect the rights of others.  Examples of sexual harassment include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Verbal:</strong> Sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature, sexual propositions, threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nonverbal:</strong> Sexually suggestive objects or pictures, graphic commentaries, suggestive or insulting sounds, leering, whistling, obscene gestures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physical:</strong> Unwanted physical contact, including touching, pinching, brushing against the body, or assault.</p></li>
</ol><p>Other discriminatory harassment is defined as verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of his/her age, race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, veteran status, national origin, ancestry or disability.</p>

<p>Anyone who believes he or she has been the subject of sexual harassment, or any other type of discrimination, should report all of the facts and circumstances immediately, either to the Office Manager or the Management Team.  A confidential investigation of all complaints will be undertaken immediately.  Any employee who has been found to have harassed another individual will be subject to appropriate sanctions, including immediate termination.   </p>

<h2>
<a name="dismissal-without-cause-at-will" class="anchor" href="#dismissal-without-cause-at-will"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dismissal Without Cause (At-Will)</h2>

<p>The Commonwealth of Virginia is an "At-Will" employment state. Therefore, by law, COS is an “At-Will” place of business. Virginia’s “At-Will” law means that either you or COS may terminate your employment for any reason at anytime.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="involuntary-separation" class="anchor" href="#involuntary-separation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Involuntary Separation</h2>

<p>Separation is any action that ends the employee-employer relationship between an individual and the COS.  Involuntary separation may be initiated when disciplinary action does not produce required workplace behavior. Disciplinary action may be initiated in response to performance of duties and personal misconduct.  The directorship will be responsible for initiation of disciplinary action in consultation with the employee's immediate supervisor.  The procedures for disciplinary action are the following:</p>

<p><strong>Performance of Duties:</strong>  These include violation of the personnel policies or violation of an employee's position requirements.  Specific examples include inefficiency or incompetence in performance of duties, tardiness, absenteeism, improper use of property or equipment, failure to maintain professional interpersonal relationships, and abusive or obscene language.  These examples are not exhaustive of the category.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Warning:</strong>   The supervisor shall advise the employee of the specific infraction or breach of duty and the date of the incident. The employee has the opportunity to explain the reason for the conduct. The Office Manager will prepare a memorandum for the personnel file documenting the infraction and employee’s response. The directorship shall monitor progress and review with the employee. Progress and review will be documented in the employee’s personnel file. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probation:</strong>  Repetition of an infraction may result in probation. Repeated incidents will be documented as described in step one. Probation shall be for at least 90 days.  During this period, a review process will determine if the required corrective actions are implemented and effective. No salary increases or bonuses will be given while an employee is on probation. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Termination:</strong> Continued repetition by an employee, of an infraction which has been specified in a written warning, will result in the termination of the employee.  This is the final disciplinary step for infractions under the performance of duties category.</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>Personal Misconduct:</strong> Disciplinary action under this category results from employee misconduct that is contrary to the best interests of the COS and is more serious than performance of duty infractions. Specific examples of serious personal misconduct actions include being convicted of a felony, misusing funds, fighting or attempting bodily injury to another COS staff member or visitor, using abusive or threatening language, sexual harassment, divulging confidential information, theft or dishonesty, intoxication or possession of illegal substances, possession of weapons on COS premises,  soliciting tips from clients, and falsifying documents.  These examples are not exhaustive of the category. Any employee may be terminated immediately for a serious offense.  The following process applies: </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Suspension:</strong>  Should a serious personal misconduct occur, the employee shall be suspended immediately without pay while the case is investigated.  A memorandum delineating the basis for the suspension shall be placed in the employee's personnel file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investigation:</strong>   The activity that resulted in the suspension will be investigated by the directorship.  All facts and related information will be considered.  A memorandum summarizing the investigation and the decision shall be forwarded to the suspended employee and placed in his or her personnel file within ten (10) working days.  </p></li>
<li><p>**Dismissal/Reinstatement: **The directorship, based on the outcome of the investigation, shall terminate or reinstate the employee.  If the employee is reinstated, the directorship shall also elect whether to consider this suspension as disciplinary time-off without pay, or to compensate the employee for the period of suspension.</p></li>
</ol><h2>
<a name="reduction-in-force" class="anchor" href="#reduction-in-force"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reduction in Force</h2>

<p>The COS may terminate employees due to organizational realities including but not limited to: a lack of funds, elimination of position(s), termination of contract, reorganization, and restrictions of funding agencies.  Such termination will be considered a Reduction in Force and the following principles shall apply:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Consideration will be given to the need for the position, performance history, compensation, and seniority at the COS </p></li>
<li><p>Whenever possible, at least thirty (30) days notice will be given to a terminated employee.</p></li>
<li><p>Appropriate information and support for filing unemployment claims will be provided.</p></li>
</ol><h2>
<a name="resignation" class="anchor" href="#resignation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resignation</h2>

<p>Resignation is a separation from the COS initiated by the employee.  Employees, with the exception of contract employees, may terminate their employment voluntarily at any time and shall give the COS at least two weeks written notice prior to the effective date.  Contracts employees will be required to give sufficient notice, as outlined in their employment agreement.  Employees who resign may be accompanied by an exit interview. Employees are required to work during his or her two-week resignation period. No pre-scheduled vacation or sick leave may be taken during this time. </p>

<h2>
<a name="exit-interview" class="anchor" href="#exit-interview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exit Interview</h2>

<p>Any employee terminating employment for any reason will be scheduled for an exit interview with the directorship prior to departure. All information will be strictly confidential. The purpose of this interview is to establish a reason for the termination, and obtain from the employee information and observations that might be helpful to the COS for improving its policies and practices.</p>
